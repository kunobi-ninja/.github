  A native Kubernetes workspace built with Tauri (Rust + React). Not Electron.

  Clusters, GitOps (Flux, Argo), logs, troubleshooting, all in one place. 

  No browser, no context switching, no login walls.

  Desktop, airgapped, with AI?, only-human. You decide

  ## Why

  Debugging a failing deployment shouldn't mean jumping between kubectl, a browser dashboard, Grafana, and
  three terminal windows. We built Kunobi because we needed a single tool that starts instantly, connects
  to all our clusters, and lets us fix things instead of staring at graphs.

  ## What it does

  Manage multiple clusters from one window. See what's deployed, detect drift, inspect resources, tail
  logs, track Helm histories. Flux and Argo states are first-class, not an afterthought.

  Plugins coming soon, shape it your way.
